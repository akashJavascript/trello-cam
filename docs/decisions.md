# Decisions log

Decisions made after `docs/BRIEF.md`, newest last. Answers to the brief's open questions go here too.

## 2026-10-01: planning (see `docs/PLAN.md`)

- **Repo root** is `C:\dev\frc-autocam`, remote `github.com/akashJavascript/trello-cam`.
- **Thickness comes from Fusion.**
  - The service batches by material + color only.
  - Fusion measures each part's thickness, snaps it to the material's stock thicknesses, and nests each
    thickness separately, so every sheet is still one stock type.
  - A non-stock thickness goes to `Needs fixing`.
- **Config is TOML** (`config/autocam.toml`). Fusion never reads it; jobs are self-contained JSON.
- **Pauses** default to `.tap` text insertion (pure Python, tested). Manual NC becomes an option only if the API
  probe shows it can be created. No pause after the last part on a sheet.
- **Short quantity:** if a card's full qty doesn't fit, none of its copies are cut this run, and the card stays
  in `Ready for CAM`.
- **Post:** use the pinned `.cps` by path if the API allows. Otherwise use the library post after verifying it
  against the pinned sha256. Every post property is set explicitly on every post.
- **Program names** carry a run number (`6061_0p125_r017_S1`).

## 2026-10-01: M0

- **`.gitattributes` fixed.** The catch-all `* text=auto` was last, which overrode `*.cps -text` /
  `*.tap -text`. It now comes first, and a test enforces the order.
- **Post properties.** The post also defines `writeMachine` and `writeTools` (both false); config sets them.

## 2026-10-01: overnight work on `m1-offline` (defaults; say if any is wrong)

- **Cards with a `.step` file instead of an Onshape link** need a `Material: 6061` line, since there's no
  Onshape material to read. `PC` means clear; add the `Smoked` label for smoked.
- **The service checks programs against its own copy of each job** (`state/jobs/<job_id>.json`), never the
  copy in Fusion's output folder.
- **Re-check before upload.** The `.tap` guard and pause verification (`autocam_core.sheetcheck`) run in
  Fusion and again in the service on the exact bytes before upload. A `.tap` can only be uploaded through
  `Tracker.attach_program`, which needs a passing guard report with the same sha256.
- **The guard also checks clamp clearance.** Any move over a clamp strip must be at or above stock top + clamp
  height + `tapguard.clamp_margin_in` (default 0.25 in). The post doesn't retract between ops, so this checks
  the real file.
- **Unfinished Onshape exports are resumed, not repaid.**
  - A STEP translation that doesn't finish within the poll budget is remembered.
  - The next run polls it instead of starting a new one.
  - Parts that can't be exported yet (offline, or translation still running) leave their card in Ready for
    CAM rather than sending it to Needs fixing.
- **When a sheet's program is rejected**, its part cards go to Needs fixing with an explanation, so the next
  run doesn't nest them again before a human looks.
- **Shared Part Studio lookups.** The parts list of a Part Studio version is fetched once and shared by every
  card that links to it. Card titles must match exactly one part name, and duplicate names are rejected.
- **`make-job`** builds a job from local STEP files (part source `local`) for manual Fusion runs in M1.2.
- **Onshape API version and auth.** Requests use `/api/v10` and HMAC request signing. The response field
  names (`partId`, `bodyType`, `material.displayName`, `requestState`, `resultExternalDataIds`) follow the
  docs and still need confirming on the first supervised run (M3).

## 2026-10-01: rules added after the independent safety review

- **Bytes.** A program must be printable ASCII with one consistent line ending (CRLF or LF). A lone CR, tab or
  other control byte fails, because the controller might split lines differently from the guard.
- **Fixed G/M sets.** The guard only accepts G0-4, G20, G53, G73, G80-83, G90 and M0, M3, M5, M11, M12, whatever
  config says. Config can narrow this, never widen it.
- **No sideways rapid below the stock top.** A `G0` that moves in X/Y below the stock top fails, and so does
  drilling travel between holes below it. Vertical rapids below the top (e.g. re-entering a pocket) are
  allowed. **Watch for this in M1.2:** if Fusion's real output trips it on a good template, we'll look at the
  actual pattern before loosening it.
- **The service re-derives the cut plan.**
  - The sheet thickness must be one of the job material's stock thicknesses.
  - The tool must be one of the job's tools.
  - The program's `[outer ...]` ops must be exactly the planned order, covering every placed copy.
  - Card pause counts come from the service's own check.
- **A run is saved before it does anything.** A crash or Trello failure mid-start resumes the same run; it
  never starts a new one and never re-exports.
- **Dry runs are separate.** They keep their own state folder (`state/dryrun/`) and `d001`-style run ids.
- **What can sit in Ready to cut.**
  - Rejected sheet cards are always moved out.
  - A sheet card the service made must have its full review checklist ticked.
  - Cards the service didn't make are left alone.
- **Second review pass** (verifying the fixes) found and fixed three more:
  - **Run ids:** a new run never reuses a run id the hot folder already holds, even if `state/` was wiped.
    A fresh run's job ids must be new, or the submit fails loudly.
  - **Stuck writes:** a Trello write that keeps failing (e.g. a deleted card) is given up after 3 ticks and
    noted, so it can't keep a run active forever.
  - **Zero-job runs:** such a run is only marked done after its control-card comment and move land.
- **Templates use full retraction.** The worker reports nominal stock thickness in `result.json`.

## 2026-10-01: what the team's manual CAM actually does (from `dump_params`)

These are inputs for the templates in M1.2-M1.5, not decisions yet. One aluminum job (3/16 in plate, 4 mm alu tool):
- **Work origin:** Stock box point, `'bottom 1'`, with the WCS Z and X axes picked explicitly.
- **Stock:** the part bounding box plus 0.04 in on the sides and top, 0 on the bottom. The automation will use
  the full sheet as stock instead.
- **Heights:**
  - Retract and feed are 0.2 in above the stock top.
  - Clearance is 0.4 in above retract, about 0.6 in above the stock top. The brief assumed 2.0 in
    (`clamps.min_clear_above_stock_in`, still ASSUMED). The guard only rejects moves that cross a clamp strip,
    so the lower value may be fine; decide when the clamp numbers are confirmed.
- **Bottoms:**
  - Drill and bore: "from hole bottom", offset 0, no drill-tip-through, no break-through.
  - Contours: "from contour", offset 0.

  These already match the never-below-Z0 rule.
- **Linking:** "keep tool down" off, high feedrate mode disabled, single depth with a 2° profile ramp.
- **Tabs are on** in this job (2.5 in spacing; one contour uses manual tabs). The brief assumes tape and no
  tabs, so the no-tab trial (open question 10) matters.
- **Pockets** are cut with 2D Adaptive Clearing, not the Pocket strategy. The `[pocket]` op in the templates
  should be a 2D Adaptive op.

## 2026-10-01: tool library switched to the team's current one

- **Which library.** The pinned `fusion/tools/5940_Tool_Library.tools` is now the team's library as saved in
  March 2026. It replaces the older copy that came with the brief.
- **What changed.** The same tools have **new GUIDs**:
  - 4 mm alu `e5dd75b2-…`
  - 4 mm poly `b4521723-…`
  - 1/8 alu `dc1f12bd-…`

  It adds **1/8 polycarbonate** (`7a26b9db-…`, T12, 96 ipm / 10 ipm plunge, mist), which closes open
  question 11. It also adds a 3 mm poly (T1) and a 6 mm chamfer (T16). The Onsrud and wood spiral bits are gone.
- **Duplicate tool numbers.** T1 is now shared by three tools and T12 by two. The `.tap` can't say which cutter
  to load, so the card's `LOAD:` line and the GUID check matter more.
- **Lesson.** GUIDs are stable within one library but change when a library is re-saved or copied. Config, the
  pinned file and the templates must come from the same library. `config-check` catches config vs pinned file;
  the worker's GUID check catches templates. After importing on a new machine, confirm with `dump_params`.
- **Poly 1/8 template.** `poly_eighth` is configured. Until its template file is exported, poly parts that need
  it still go to Needs fixing with the decision-13 comment.

## 2026-10-01: from the `pipeline_probe` results

- **Every outline must reach the stock bottom.** The probe's programs passed the Z-floor check but never went
  below Z 0.125 (the plate top), because the smoke template used the team's "From contour" bottom height and the
  automation selects the top face. The sheet check (both in Fusion and in the service) now rejects any
  `[outer ...]` op whose lowest Z isn't the floor (within 0.0005 in, the posting precision). The card names the
  op and says to set the template's bottom height to stock bottom, offset 0.
- **A rejected sheet's `result.json` carries every reason.** The worker reports each `SheetCheck.problems()`
  line as a `TAP_REJECTED` error, not just the guard summary, so the card says why (the fake worker does this
  too).
- **Arrange: occurrences, one Arrange per sheet, our own offsets.** Faces can't be added; quantity and
  multiple envelopes need the Manufacturing Extension; `resultEnvelopes` doesn't include the offset. Details and
  the open questions are in `docs/fusion-api-status.md`.

## 2026-10-01: from the second `pipeline_probe2` run

- **The worker sets the bottom height of `[outer]` and `[inner]` ops to stock bottom, offset 0** (default; say if
  wrong). The automation selects each part's top face, and with the team's usual "From contour" that cuts
  nothing (Z 0.125 on a 0.125 in plate). Setting it from the API works. Other ops (`[drill]`, `[bore]`,
  `[pocket]`) keep the template's heights. The sheet check stays as the backstop.
- **Pauses stay as text inserted into the `.tap`.** A Manual NC Stop posts only `M0` (no retract, spindle stop,
  mist off or park), and the guard rejects it.
